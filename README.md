# TeamCity Slack plugin

This plugin allows you to integrate your CI with Slack.

The main feature is that you can specify not exact branch name but the [regexp branch mask](#build-configuration).

For example you have separate build configurations for feature branches and common branches. Then it is easy to
setup notifications into corresponding Slack channels.

The second big thing is that your can compose your own messages using [template placeholders](#message-placeholders) and [Slack formatting](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-formatting).

And you can easily send notification without running the build with *Try it* feature.

Plugin automatically backups its settings after each modification.

That's it! Now you can open any build configuration home and choose **Slack** tab.

Notifications for branches captured by regular expression will be sent to slack channel.
Message will be compiled according to template.

The build settings number is not limited, so you can set up notifications for feature branches 
in one channel, and for release branches in another one.
